# SOCI40133-project

**Question**

My project examines fan-fiction on the Archive of Our Own (AO3) platform to explore the interplay between individual creativity and collective cultural patterns. It aims to understand how the narratives shared and consumed within this community influence and reflect broader participatory culture dynamics.

**Data**

The research focuses on AO3 fan-fiction texts from 2009 to 2020 and other fan-fiction data including comments, hits, finished or not, etc.

**Methods**
+ Using word embedding to analyze semantic changes.
+ Applying topic modeling to identify prevalent themes.
+ Integrating deep learning for causal inference between linguistic patterns and cultural trends.
